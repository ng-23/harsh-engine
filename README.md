# harsh-engine
A simple web app intentionally designed to have numerous common vulnerabilities.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment.
3. Run `poetry install` if using Poetry for dependency management or `pip install -r -e requirements.txt` if just using pip.
4. Launch the Flask app by running `flask --app src/harsh_engine/app/app run --debug`.
5. Open your browser and go to `localhost:5000` to view the index page. Good luck :)
